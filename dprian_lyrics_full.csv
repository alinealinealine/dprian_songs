COMING TO YOU LIVE
I'm sailing over Saturn
[Verse 1]
Take a listen
이걸 듣고 나면 알게 될 걸
왜 우릴 못 담는지 너의 chart가
Witness the difference
우린 숫자들로 수치화를 할 수 없는 수채화를 그려가
We'll run the distance
여정이 길어져도 타협 없어
We run the distance to
Where we glisten
Only space can hold us

If I die, why would I care?

Do you feel it?
Well I feel it
If you don't feel it just feel it
All I'm saying is just feel it
No, no, no, don't think it just feel it
Feel it in your nerves
Feel it in your heart
And then let those feelings curve
Let it curve and merge
Into the universe and see it disperse

I don't mind, how I got here
If I die, why would I care?

You know it`s been a long time
And I missed ya
But now it`s cold
집으로 돌아가던 길
많은 사람들 속에서
익숙한 향기가 나
느낌이 와
단번에 너란 걸 알아
어찌나 반갑던지
나도 몰래 웃음을 지었지
근데 넌 아닌가봐
어색한 정적이 흘렀지
무슨 말부터 꺼내야 할지
한참을 고민했어
하긴 그럴만도 하지
좋지 않았던 우리의 끝
It's so cold
멈춰버린 너와 나
It's so cold
예전과는 너무 다르게
차가워진 니 앞에 난
I'm so cold
사실 웃고만 있어도
말하지 않아도
너의 눈엔 모든 게 보여
Baby 넌 나 못 속여 Girl
차가워진 어두운 밤
Just don`t forget it
넌 아직 내가 싫은가봐
Just tell me why
닿으면 얼어 버릴 것 같은
니 차가운 입술
말 한마디 마다 차가워
내게 날아와 비수
이젠 나 어떡해
You're cold like ice winter
아직도 난 너만 보고 있는데
이렇게 널 보는데
무슨 말부터 꺼내야할지
한참을 고민했어
하긴 그럴만도 하지
좋지 않았던 우리의 끝
It's so cold
멈춰버린 너와 나
It's so cold
예전과는 너무 다르게
차가워진 니 앞에 난
I'm so cold
니 마음은 너무 차가워
So cold
너와 떨어지지 않게
널 꽉 잡아
So hold on
My baby girl
너는 너무 예쁜 걸
그러니 어떻게 포기하겠어
이리도 완벽한 널
난 오늘도 니 생각만 하는데
이렇게 널 보며 매일 행복해
웃음 짓곤 하는데 Lady
아직도 모르겠어
난 널 보면 내 맘이
녹아버릴 것 같아
All night
오늘도 차가운 넌
나를 외면할 것 같아
무슨 말부터 꺼내야할지
한참을 고민했어
하긴 그럴만도 하지
좋지 않았던 우리의 끝
It's so cold
멈춰버린 너와 나
It's so cold
예전과는 너무 다르게
차가워진 니 앞에 난
I'm so cold"

I'll see you on the other side
Where our worlds will collide
And take what's yours
Just leave me in two pieces
I flushed my heart down in the basement
Where all the ravens take their turns
Picking at what's left, oh
I took you out of my existence
Only to crawl back into your arms
Knowing how much it will make me go insane
The grass is always meaner on the other side"

[Verso 1]
Ey, chica, escuché que estás dejando la ciudad
Ey, chica, puede que no importe ahora
Ey, chica, tal vez funcionó de alguna manera
Eso es lo que me digo
Cuando te acuestes esta noche
Tantas veces que podría haber aguantado
Todavía no puedo creer que te dejé sola
Me rompe en pedazos, ella nunca sabrá
Lo mucho que desearía nunca haberte dejado ir
[Refrán]
Hola, ¿cómo estás?
Escuché que te ves feliz ahora
Hola, ¿cómo estás?
No te preocupes por mí porque estoy bien
[Verso 2]
Así que pasaste alrededor de mi casa (Ooh-ooh)
Y dejaste tus huellas con las puntas de tus dedos
Estoy sentado donde tú te sentaste (Ooh-ooh)
Y ahora él está buscando algo sin sentido
